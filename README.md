My Microsoft Small Basic v0.9 practice codes from the "Introduction to Programming" tutorial by Vijaye Raji. I did this as part of the Microsoft DreamSpark initiative during the academic year 2010-11. The codes were tested on Windows XP SP3 (32-bit) with .NET framework 3.5 SP1

**What are the unique features of the Small Basic language?**

* Imperative: Just like the early variants of BASIC, Small Basic is imperative and doesn't use or expose beginners to concepts like scopes, types, object orientation, etc.

* Simple: The Small Basic language consists of just 14 keywords.

* Type System: There actually isn't one. You can create string and numeric constants and assign them to variables. Operations performed on these variables will be interpreted according to the content.

* Variables: All variables are global and are always initialized. They can be used without assignment.

* Events: You can create a sub- routine and assign it to an event. This will cause the sub- routine to be called when the event happens.

* Libraries: The libraries provide static "Objects" that group operations, properties and events. New libraries can be created using other .NET languages and added to the Small Basic runtime.
