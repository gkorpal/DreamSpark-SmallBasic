My [Microsoft Small Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Small_Basic) v0.1-0.5 practice codes from the "Introduction to Programming" tutorial by Ed Price. I did this as part of the [Microsoft DreamSpark](https://news.microsoft.com/2008/02/18/microsoft-gives-students-access-to-technical-software-at-no-charge-to-inspire-success-and-make-a-difference/) initiative during 2009. The codes were tested on Windows XP SP3 (32-bit) with .NET framework 3.5 SP1

**What are the unique features of the Small Basic language?**

* Imperative: Just like the early variants of BASIC, Small Basic is imperative and doesn't use or expose beginners to concepts like scopes, types, object orientation, etc.

* Simple: The Small Basic language consists of just 14 keywords.

* Type System: There actually isn't one. You can create string and numeric constants and assign them to variables. Operations performed on these variables will be interpreted according to the content.

* Variables: All variables are global and are always initialized. They can be used without assignment.

* Events: You can create a sub- routine and assign it to an event. This will cause the sub- routine to be called when the event happens.

* Libraries: The libraries provide static "Objects" that group operations, properties and events. New libraries can be created using other .NET languages and added to the Small Basic runtime.
